**What's HOOKY**
---
Hooky is a fully re-engineered, battery-powered electronic hookah system that replaces traditional charcoal-based heating with a precision-controlled electronic heating element. Powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack, Hooky integrates custom-designed PCBs featuring STM32 microcontrollers, buck converters for multi-voltage regulation, a capacitive touch interface, LED indicators, and a vibration motor for haptic feedback. The system drives the heating element through efficient high-current switching circuitry, allowing rapid heat-up times and consistent thermal management. Hooky communicates with its embedded firmware to manage safety features such as overcurrent protection, battery monitoring (via a fuel gauge IC), and thermal cutoffs, ensuring reliable operation. Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, the hardware and firmware architecture enable streamlined manufacturing, maintainability, and potential future expansion into smart connectivity.

**Repo Details**
---
The Hooky web platform is built with Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for fast, SEO-optimized performance. It serves as the user-facing layer for product information, account management, and integration with backend services. The application uses modular React components styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design, while API routes in Next.js provide seamless communication with the backend for authentication, device registration, and data handling. Optimized image loading, dynamic routing, and incremental static regeneration (ISR) ensure scalability and efficiency, making the platform both developer-friendly and production-ready.
